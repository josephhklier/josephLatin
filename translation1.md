Chaos prīmus deōrum erat. Fīliae eius, Nox et Terra, māter omnium hominum, erant. 
Haec māter Mortis et Lētī erat. 
Illīus fīliī horribilia mōnstra erant: Typhon, Python, et Cyclōpēs. 
Typhon et Python dracōnēs ingentēs erant et Cyclōpēs fabrī brūtī. 
Sed frāter eōrum Ūranus, prīmus ipse rēx deōrum. Hic fortis et magnus erat, sed sapiēns.
