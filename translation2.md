C. Translation

Long ago Prometheus, the first son of Lapetus, was made out of mud.

At the same time Vulcanus made the women out of mud.

Minerva gave her soul and all the gods sent gifts to him.

For that reason her name was Pandora.

Pandora was given by Jupiter marriage with Epimetheo.

Their daughter was Pyrrha, the first mortal.
