C. Translation

When the Greeks were not able to capture Troy after ten years, Epeus made a wooden horse. 

On the horse he gathered, Menelaus, Odysseus, Diaomedes, Thessander, Stheneleus, Acamas, Thoas, Mactian, Neoptolemus.

On the horse it wrote, "The Greeks give Athena a gift", and they brought the military camp to Tenedos. 

When the trojans were able to see, they thought that the enemy went away; Priam ordered that the horse be brought into the temple of Minervae. 

When the prophet Cassandra says the horse has enemies, she has confidence they will not be able to have the horse in the temple.

The Greeks all stretched to grasp the gate but all the guards and Troy fell.
